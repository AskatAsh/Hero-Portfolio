        I also try to develop some new ideas and to put them in action. That's why I think everyone should follow these

          notes without leaving your browser </strong>and also saves your notes on the web.
        I am also trying my best to improve this project in whichever way I can. As a result, I am trying to add a
        Reminer function to remind you in specific time.
